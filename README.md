# Building Stock Estimation Enhancement Framework (BSEEF)
## Introduction
The purpose of this repository is to share the basic structure of BSEEF with researchers who are interested in and conducting approximation studies. Using the scripts shared here, researchers can either reproduce the results in the article "*Adaptive Nighttime Light-Based Building Stock Assessment Framework for Future Environmentally Sustainable Management*", or develop their own version of the model within the framework according to their needs.

**Adaptive Nighttime Light-Based Building Stock Assessment Framework for Future Environmentally Sustainable Management**

The accumulation of artificial built environment stock during urbanization processes has been ac-tively involved in altering the material and energy use pattern of human societies. Therefore, ac-curate assessment of built environment stock can provide insights for decision-makers to implement appropriate environmentally sustainable retrofitting strategies. This study presents Building Stock Estimation Enhancement Framework (BSEEF) that leverages nighttime light (NTL) to accurately assess and spatially map building stocks. By innovatively integrating a region classification module with a hybrid region-specified self-optimization module, BSEEF adaptively enhance the estimation accuracy across diverse urban landscapes. A comparative case study of Japan demonstrated that BSEEF significantly outperformed a traditional linear regression model, with improvements ranging from 1.81% to 16.75% across different metrics used for assessment, providing more accurate building stock estimates. BSEEF enhances environment/sustainability studies by enabling precise spatial analysis of built environment stocks, offering a versatile and robust framework that adapts to technological changes and achieves superior accuracy without extensive reliance on complex da-tasets. These advances will make BSEEF an indispensable tool in strategic planning for urban de-velopment, promoting sustainable and resilient communities globally.
